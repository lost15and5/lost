                           <p>The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (transl.â€‰Central School Organization) is a system of central government schools in India that are instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Education, Government of India. As of April 2023, it has a total of 1,253 schools in India, and three abroad in Kathmandu, Moscow and Tehran. It is one of the world's largest chains of schools and also the largest chain of schools in India. It is controlled by 25 Regional Offices and 05 ZIETs (Zonal Institute of Education and Training) under KVS (HQ).

In April 2022, the Centre decided to remove an MP quota for KV students, invalidating parliamentarians' recommendations for admission to the schools.[2]</p>

                           <h3>History</h3>

                           <p>It is a system of central government schools in India and other countries[3] that have been instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Education[4] and came into being in 1963 under the name Central Schools.[5] Later, the name was changed to Kendriya Vidyalaya. It is a non-profit organisation. Its schools are all affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).[3] Its objective is to educate children of the Indian Defence Services personnel who are often posted to remote locations. With the army starting its own Army Public Schools, the service was extended but not restricted to all central government employees.

A uniform curriculum is followed by schools all over India. By providing a common syllabus and system of education, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are intended to ensure that the children of government employees do not face educational disadvantages when their parents are transferred from one location to another. The schools have been operational for more than 60 years.</p>

                           <h4>Management</h4>

                           <p>The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan or 'Central School Organisation'(as previously known), oversees the functioning of the schools with its headquarters in New Delhi.[3] The administration of this body is based on three levels. The chairman of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is always the Minister in Charge of the Ministry of Education of the Government of India; the deputy chairman is the Minister of State of the Ministry of Education. The real working power lies with the Commissioner of KVS. There are Additional Commissioners and Joint commissioners to accompany the Commissioner in the administration of KVS in different fields. The head of the KVs in a region is a Deputy Commissioner accompanied by two to three Assistant Commissioners. At present, there are 25 regional offices in KVS. There are individual principals of every KV, administering the schools along with a Vice-Principal (wherever there is a vacancy for the post) and Head Master/ Mistress.

The Vidyalaya also has several committees for the holistic development of the students and well maintenance of the school compound and system. The most important one is the VMC (Vidyalaya Management Committee), which is the head of all committees.</p>
